## Description
_Duration: weekend project

This is a Javascript feedback app with the front end built with React. The user inputs their responses to each question and clicks the next button which routes to a different component. The data is stored locally and then dispatched to Redux Reducers. At the end, the data is then posted to the database and resets the Reducer state.
